**ecoli_simulation.py**  
  Simulates a theoritcal model of the Ecoli division and Glucose & Galactose consumption.
  The Ecoli cell division duration is downscaled from 20min to 2min to obtain a wider range on the graph.  
  A detailed report of the concept, modelling and simulation can be found in our **[report](https://github.com/Swastik-RUG/Modelling-Simulation/blob/dev/report/E_Coli_Colony_simulation_team_19_report.pdf)**  

### Simulations:
 
## Static Snapshots of the Simulation can be found in the [images/ folder](https://github.com/Swastik-RUG/Modelling-Simulation/tree/dev/images)

## Create you Custom Simulations by following these steps

- Clone this repository
- Find the **"conf.ini"** file.
  ![](images/conf_ini.PNG)
- Execute the **"ecoli_simulation.py"** and select **simulation mode "custom"**
  ![](images/CustomSimulationRun.PNG)
- Done

## Conf.ini meaning of independent variables

lactose count: An integer value, which can be used to set the initial lactose molecule count in the system.
- **glucose count:** An integer value, which can be used to set the initial glucose molecule count in the system.
- **galactose count:** An integer value, which can be used to set the initial galactose molecule count in the system.
- **lactase:** An integer value, which can be used to set the initial glucose lactase or beta-galactosidase count in the
system.
- **ecoli:** An integer value, which can be used to set the initial ecoli count in the system.
- **iterations:** Number of iterations the simulation has to be performed.
- **replenish interval:** If the experimenter wants to simulate an environment where the carbon sources are replenished for specific time-frames. If this value is set to 0, the simulation will not replenish any resources, if it
is set to a R, where R Â¿ 0; the simulation will replenish the carbon sources in the intervals R,2R,3R.....
- **replenish glucose:** An integer value, which can be set to indicate the glucose count that has to be replenished
at replenish intervals.
- **replenish galactose:** An integer value, which can be set to indicate the galactose count that has to be replenished at replenish intervals.
- **replenish lactose:** An integer value, which can be set to indicate the lactose count that has to be replenished
at replenish intervals.
